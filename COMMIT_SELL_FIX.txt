Fix sell execution errors with enhanced logging and fallback price fetch

Issue: Bot stops executing sells when emergency stop is active; positions aren't closing on SL/TP.

Root Cause: 
- analyze_symbol() may fail silently, preventing price fetch for position management
- Without prices, SL/TP exit checks can't run, blocking all sells

Fix:
- Add verbose logging to manage_open_positions() to identify failures
- Add fallback price fetch via broker.get_current_price(symbol) if analyze_symbol fails
- Log every position being managed and each price fetch attempt
- Ensure sells can proceed even with very low account balance
