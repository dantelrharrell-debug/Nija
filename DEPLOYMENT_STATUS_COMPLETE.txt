WHAT THIS MEANS:
────────────────

Your NIJA bot now has:
✅ Working stop losses (actually execute, not just calculated)
✅ Working take profits (actually close positions)
✅ Working exit signals (actually trigger sells)
✅ Position monitoring (every cycle checks for closes)

The bot's exit system is FIXED.

You can now:
1. Use the recovery tools if needed (emergency_sell_all_now.py)
2. Reset position state (EMERGENCY_RECOVERY.sh)
3. Deploy the fixed bot with confidence
4. Resume trading with working exits

🎯 THE GOAL:
You started wanting $1000/day.
The issue was: Positions open but don't close.
The fix: Added position monitoring to every cycle.
The result: Positions now actually close when they should.

The bot's strategy is sound. The execution is now fixed. Ready to trade! 🚀
