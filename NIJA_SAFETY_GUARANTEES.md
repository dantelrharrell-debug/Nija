**For:** All NIJA Users

## 🛡️ Your Safety Is Our Priority

NIJA is designed with multiple layers of protection to keep your trading safe and transparent. Here's what we guarantee:

---

## ✅ Core Safety Guarantees

### 1. **Your Funds Stay On Your Exchange - Always**
- ✅ NIJA **NEVER** holds or controls your funds
- ✅ All money remains in **YOUR** exchange account (Coinbase, Kraken, etc.)
- ✅ We only have **trading permissions** via API keys
- ✅ **NO withdrawal permissions** - we cannot move your money
- ✅ You can **revoke access instantly** through your exchange

**What This Means:** Even if NIJA's servers disappeared, your funds are safe on your exchange account.

---

### 2. **Tier-Based Capital Protection (Enforced Everywhere)**
- ✅ Position sizes **automatically scale** to your account balance
- ✅ Smaller accounts = Smaller positions = Lower risk
- ✅ **Cannot be bypassed** in any environment (paper, live, all tiers)
- ✅ Progressive risk limits as your account grows

**Example:**
- $100 account → Maximum $2 position size (2%)
- $1,000 account → Maximum $20 position size (2%)
- $10,000 account → Maximum $200 position size (2%)

---

### 3. **Multiple Stop-Loss Mechanisms**
Every trade has **mandatory protection**:
- ✅ **Technical stop-loss** placed at support levels
- ✅ **Percentage-based stop** limits max loss per trade (-2% to -5%)
- ✅ **Daily loss limit** circuit breaker (default 5%)
- ✅ **Maximum drawdown protection** (default 15%)
- ✅ **Cannot be disabled** by user (enforced for safety)

**What This Means:** Your losses are capped automatically on every trade.

---

### 4. **Independent Trading Model**
- ✅ **Each account operates independently** - not copy trading
- ✅ Positions sized **proportionally to YOUR balance**
- ✅ **Same algorithm, different results** (transparently disclosed)
- ✅ Your account makes **its own decisions**

**Why Results Differ:**
- Network timing variations (milliseconds matter)
- Your account balance determines position size
- Your existing positions affect new trades
- Market prices change between executions

---

### 5. **Exchange Minimum Enforcement**
- ✅ **Prevents unprofitable micro-trades** that fees would eat
- ✅ Coinbase: $2.00 minimum per trade
- ✅ Kraken: $10.50 minimum per trade
- ✅ Accounts too small to profit are **automatically blocked**

**What This Means:** We won't let you take trades that can't be profitable after fees.

---

### 6. **Fee-Aware Position Sizing**
- ✅ All trades account for **1.0% round-trip fees** (entry + exit)
- ✅ Minimum profit targets set to **1.5%** (to overcome fees)
- ✅ Trades that can't overcome fees are **rejected**

**Example:**
- $100 trade has $1.00 in fees → needs 1.5% gain to profit
- Ensures every trade has realistic profit potential

---

### 7. **Full Control & Transparency**
You maintain **complete control** at all times:
- ✅ **Pause/Resume** trading with one tap
- ✅ **Kill-switch** to stop all trading instantly
- ✅ **Close all positions** manually anytime
- ✅ **Revoke API access** via exchange (instant cutoff)
- ✅ **Export all data** and delete your account

**Real-Time Visibility:**
- Live position tracking
- Instant P&L updates
- Complete trade history
- Performance analytics
- Safety alerts and notifications

---

## 🚨 Important Risk Disclosures

### **What We Guarantee:**
- ✅ Transparent operation
- ✅ Safety mechanisms enforced
- ✅ Your funds never leave your exchange
- ✅ Full user control maintained
- ✅ Proportional position sizing
- ✅ Multiple layers of protection

### **What We Do NOT Guarantee:**
- ❌ Profits or positive returns
- ❌ Specific win rate or performance
- ❌ Identical results between accounts
- ❌ Zero losses (trading has risk)
- ❌ Future performance matching past results

---

## ⚠️ Critical User Responsibilities

### **You Must:**
1. **Read and understand risks** before trading with real money
2. **Only invest what you can afford to lose** completely
3. **Monitor your account regularly** (at least daily recommended)
4. **Start small** when graduating from paper to live trading
5. **Use strong passwords** and two-factor authentication
6. **Grant trading-only API permissions** (no withdrawal rights)
7. **Comply with laws and tax obligations** in your jurisdiction
