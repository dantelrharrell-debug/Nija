Fix critical bug: position management blocked by FORCE_EXIT_ALL logic

ROOT CAUSE:
- FORCE_EXIT_ALL.conf file exists from previous emergency stop
- When emergency stop is active AND force exit suppressed, bot returns early (line 2342)
- This prevents manage_open_positions() from ever running
- Result: NO sell exits occur, positions can't close on SL/TP

SYMPTOMS OBSERVED:
- Railway logs show 18+ iterations with zero position management
- No "📊 Managing N open position(s)" logs appear
- Enhanced logging from previous commit never executes
- Bot stuck in infinite loop printing emergency warnings

FIX APPLIED:
- Remove early return when FORCE_EXIT_ALL is suppressed during emergency stop
- Allow run_cycle() to continue to manage_open_positions()
- Positions can now exit via SL/TP/trailing even when emergency stop active
- Force exit logic properly wrapped in else block to avoid double-execution

FILES CHANGED:
- bot/trading_strategy.py: Fixed FORCE_EXIT_ALL early return logic (lines 2330-2353)

TESTING REQUIRED:
1. Verify manage_open_positions() runs on next Railway deployment
2. Check for "📊 Managing 12 open position(s)" in logs
3. Confirm sells execute when SL/TP conditions met
4. Monitor that emergency stop still blocks new buys (working correctly)

DEPLOY IMMEDIATELY: This blocks all sell functionality in production
