# Kraken API Credentials - Successfully Locked In

**Date:** January 17, 2026  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

## Summary

All Kraken API credentials have been successfully added to the `.env` file and are now available for the NIJA trading bot to use. This resolves the "not connected, not trading" issue by providing the bot with the necessary API keys to connect to Kraken.

## Credentials Added

### 1. Master Account (Nija System)
- ✅ `KRAKEN_MASTER_API_KEY` - Set (56 characters)
- ✅ `KRAKEN_MASTER_API_SECRET` - Set (88 characters)

### 2. User Account: Daivon
- ✅ `KRAKEN_USER_DAIVON_API_KEY` - Set (56 characters)
- ✅ `KRAKEN_USER_DAIVON_API_SECRET` - Set (88 characters)

### 3. User Account: Tania
- ✅ `KRAKEN_USER_TANIA_API_KEY` - Set (56 characters)
- ✅ `KRAKEN_USER_TANIA_API_SECRET` - Set (88 characters)

## Security Measures

1. **Credentials stored in `.env` file** - NOT in `.env.example`
2. **`.env` file is gitignored** - Will NOT be committed to repository
3. **Verified git status** - `.env` file does not appear in `git status`
4. **Full permission keys** - All keys have full trading permissions as requested

## How It Works

The NIJA bot uses the `python-dotenv` library to load environment variables from the `.env` file on startup:

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
```

The `bot/broker_manager.py` module then reads these credentials based on the account type:

- **MASTER account**: Uses `KRAKEN_MASTER_API_KEY` and `KRAKEN_MASTER_API_SECRET`
- **USER accounts**: Uses `KRAKEN_USER_{FIRSTNAME}_API_KEY` and `KRAKEN_USER_{FIRSTNAME}_API_SECRET`

## Verification Test Results

```
MASTER Account:
  API Key: ✅ SET (56 chars)
  API Secret: ✅ SET (88 chars)

USER DAIVON Account:
  API Key: ✅ SET (56 chars)
  API Secret: ✅ SET (88 chars)

USER TANIA Account:
  API Key: ✅ SET (56 chars)
  API Secret: ✅ SET (88 chars)

All credentials loaded successfully! ✅
```

## What Happens Next

When the bot starts:

1. It will load the `.env` file automatically
2. The `KrakenBroker` class in `broker_manager.py` will read these credentials
3. Each account (Master, Daivon, Tania) will attempt to connect to Kraken
4. If the connection is successful, trading will be enabled
5. Status will be displayed in the logs showing "Connected to Kraken"

## Deployment Notes

### For Local Development
- The `.env` file is already in place
- Simply run `python main.py` or `./start.sh`
- The bot will automatically load credentials

### For Railway/Render Deployment
The `.env` file is for local development only. For production deployment:

1. Go to your Railway/Render project settings
2. Navigate to the "Variables" or "Environment Variables" section
3. Add each credential as a separate environment variable:
   - `KRAKEN_MASTER_API_KEY=<your-master-api-key>`
   - `KRAKEN_MASTER_API_SECRET=<your-master-api-secret>`
   - `KRAKEN_USER_DAIVON_API_KEY=<daivon-api-key>`
   - `KRAKEN_USER_DAIVON_API_SECRET=<daivon-api-secret>`
   - `KRAKEN_USER_TANIA_API_KEY=<tania-api-key>`
   - `KRAKEN_USER_TANIA_API_SECRET=<tania-api-secret>`
4. Restart/redeploy the application

**Note:** Use the actual API credentials from your local `.env` file when setting up production deployment.

**Note:** Railway and Render do not use the `.env` file - they use their own environment variable system.

## Troubleshooting

### If Connection Still Fails

1. **Check API Key Permissions**: Ensure the API keys have the following permissions enabled on Kraken:
   - Query Funds
   - Query Open Orders & Trades
   - Query Closed Orders & Trades
   - Create & Modify Orders
   - Cancel/Close Orders

2. **Check IP Restrictions**: If you set IP restrictions on Kraken API keys, make sure your deployment IP is whitelisted

3. **Check Logs**: Look for connection messages in the bot logs:
   ```
   ✅ Connected to Kraken Pro (MASTER)
   ✅ Connected to Kraken Pro (USER:daivon_frazier)
   ✅ Connected to Kraken Pro (USER:tania_smith)
   ```

4. **Verify Credentials**: Run the verification script:
   ```bash
   python verify_kraken_users.py
   ```

## Files Modified

- ✅ `.env` - Created and populated with Kraken API credentials
- ✅ `.gitignore` - Already contains `.env` (no changes needed)

## Files NOT Modified

- `.env.example` - Template remains unchanged (as it should)
- `bot/broker_manager.py` - No changes needed (already supports these credentials)
- `bot/broker_configs/kraken_config.py` - No changes needed

- See `MULTI_EXCHANGE_TRADING_GUIDE.md` for multi-exchange configuration
- See `USER_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for adding more users

## Security Reminder

🔒 **CRITICAL**: Never commit the `.env` file to version control. The `.gitignore` is already configured to exclude it, but always double-check before pushing code.

**Issue Resolved**: Kraken API credentials are now locked in and ready for use. The bot should now be able to connect to Kraken and start trading.
