# NIJA Trading Tier System - Execution Requirements

## 🎯 Overview

NIJA uses a **tier-based execution system** to protect your capital from being eaten by trading fees. This guide explains what you need to know about tier minimums and why your trades might be blocked.

## 💰 Why Tier Minimums Exist

### The Fee Problem

When you place a trade, you pay fees on **both entry and exit**:

| Exchange | Entry Fee | Exit Fee | **Total Round-Trip** |
|----------|-----------|----------|----------------------|
| Coinbase | 0.60% | 0.60% | **1.20%** |
| Kraken | 0.26% | 0.26% | **0.52%** |

**Example: What happens with a $5 trade on Coinbase:**
- Entry fee: $0.03 (0.60% of $5)
- Exit fee: $0.03 (0.60% of $5)
- **Total fees: $0.06** (1.20% of $5)
- **Your trade needs to move 1.20%+ just to break even**
- **A 2% profit becomes 0.80% after fees**

This means small trades are mathematically unlikely to be profitable. NIJA prevents this by enforcing **tier-based minimums**.

## 🏆 NIJA Trading Tiers

### Tier Structure

Your tier is automatically determined by your **account balance**:

| Tier | Balance Range | Min Trade Size | Max Trade Size | Max Positions | Status |
|------|---------------|----------------|----------------|---------------|--------|

| **INCOME** | $250-$999 | $15 | $50 | 5 | Core power tier |
| **LIVABLE** | $1k-$4.9k | $25 | $100 | 6 | Stable returns |

## 🚫 Why Your Trade Was Blocked

### Common Rejection Reasons

#### 1. **Below Tier Minimum**
```
❌ ORDER VALIDATION FAILED [kraken] ETH-USD
   Reason: [INVESTOR Tier] Trade size $5.00 below tier minimum $10.00
   Account balance: $150.00
```

**What this means:**
- Your account has $150, putting you in INVESTOR tier
- INVESTOR tier requires minimum $10 trades
- You tried to place a $5 trade
- **Solution**: Wait for a stronger signal or increase position size to $10+

#### 2. **Below Account Minimum**
```
❌ ORDER VALIDATION FAILED [kraken] BTC-USD
   Reason: Account balance $15.00 below minimum tier requirement $25.00
   Cannot execute trades.
```

**What this means:**
- Your account has less than $25
- NIJA requires minimum $25 to trade (SAVER tier minimum)
- **Solution**: Deposit more funds to reach $25 minimum

#### 3. **Below Exchange Minimum**
```
❌ ORDER VALIDATION FAILED [kraken] SOL-USD
   Reason: Order size $8.00 below Kraken minimum $10.00
```

**What this means:**
- Kraken exchange requires minimum $10 per trade
- You tried to place an $8 trade
- **Solution**: Increase trade size to $10+ or wait for stronger signal

#### 4. **Unsupported Symbol**
```
❌ ORDER VALIDATION FAILED [kraken] SHIB-BUSD
   Reason: Kraken only supports USD/USDT pairs. Symbol 'SHIB-BUSD' is not supported.
```

**What this means:**
- Kraken only trades pairs ending in USD or USDT
- BUSD pairs are not supported on Kraken
- **Solution**: This trade will be skipped (or routed to Coinbase if configured)

## 🔧 How to Maximize Your Trading

### 1. **Understand Your Tier**

Check your current tier based on balance:
- < $25: ❌ Cannot trade (deposit more)
- $25-$99: SAVER (learning only)
- $100-$249: INVESTOR (first profitable tier)
- $250-$999: INCOME ⭐ (recommended)
- $1k-$4.9k: LIVABLE (scaling up)
- $5k+: BALLER (maximum flexibility)

### 2. **Deposit to Reach Next Tier**

Each tier unlock gives you:

**Example tier progression:**
- Start: $75 (SAVER) → Limited, $2 min trades

## ❓ FAQ

### Q: Why can't I trade with $10?
**A:** You can! But only if you're on **INVESTOR tier or higher** ($100+ balance) and trading on **Kraken**. Coinbase requires $25 minimum.

### Q: Can I disable tier limits?
**A:** No. Tier limits protect you from fee destruction. A $3 trade on Coinbase loses $0.04 to fees immediately. You need a 1.3% move just to break even.

### Q: Why does NIJA skip some signals?
**A:** Because executing them would **lose money to fees**. NIJA only executes trades that have a realistic chance of being profitable after fees.

### Q: What if I want to trade smaller amounts?
**A:** Options:
1. **Deposit more** to reach INVESTOR tier ($100+)
2. **Use Kraken** (lower $10 minimum vs Coinbase $25)
3. **Wait for stronger signals** that warrant larger positions

### Q: How do I see my tier?
**A:** Your tier is shown in the logs when a trade is placed:
```
✅ Tier validation passed: [INCOME] $20.00 trade
```

### Q: What's the minimum to start?
**A:** **$25** (SAVER tier). Anything less cannot execute trades.
