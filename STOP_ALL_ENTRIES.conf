# EMERGENCY TRADING HALT - POSITION CAP BYPASS FIX
# Created: 2025-12-25 12:50 UTC
# 
# Purpose: Block all new BUY entries until position count verified at or below 8
# 
# This file causes the bot to:
# - REJECT all new BUY orders
# - ALLOW exit/sell orders (liquidate positions)
# - ALLOW stop loss and take profit exits
# 
# The bot will refuse to open new positions until this file is removed
# and a manual position verification is performed.
# 
# HOW TO FIX:
# 1. Wait for bot to liquidate existing positions via stops/takes
# 2. Verify position count is exactly 8 or lower in Coinbase
# 3. Remove this file: rm STOP_ALL_ENTRIES.conf
# 4. Restart bot
#
# STATUS: Position cap enforcement will remain active (hard limit 8)
