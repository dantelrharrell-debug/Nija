Fix position enforcer dust filter and sell call signature

- Added dust position filter to skip positions with usd_value < $0.01
- Prevents infinite loops on near-zero balance positions (e.g., ADA $0)
- Corrected liquidation sell_position call signature (positional client_order_id)
- Ensures clean liquidation without missing base_size errors

Status: Position enforcer now safely liquidates without getting stuck on dust
Timeline: Ready for immediate Railway redeployment
