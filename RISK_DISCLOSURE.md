**IMPORTANT NOTICE - PLEASE READ CAREFULLY**

## Overview

This Risk Disclosure Statement describes the risks associated with using NIJA automated cryptocurrency trading platform. You must read and understand these risks before using real capital.

## Primary Risks

- Low liquidity periods
- Exchange outages

**Impact on Automated Trading:**
- Automated strategies may not adapt quickly enough
- Losses can accumulate rapidly during high volatility
- Stop-loss orders may not execute at expected prices
- Slippage can be significant

### 3. AUTOMATED TRADING RISKS

Automated trading systems have unique risks:

**Technical Risks:**
