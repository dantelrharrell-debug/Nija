🔧 Add Coinbase API Diagnostics & Credential Fix

CREDENTIALS FIX:
✅ Fixed .env EC private key formatting
   - Issue: Newlines were escaped as literal \n instead of actual line breaks
   - Fix: Converted to proper multi-line format
   - Result: API authentication now works correctly
   - Test: debug_api.py confirms successful connection

NEW DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS:
✅ debug_api.py - Complete API connection test
   - Validates .env file exists
   - Checks credentials are loaded properly
   - Tests Coinbase client initialization
   - Attempts to fetch account list
   - Shows detailed error info if anything fails

✅ find_crypto_holdings.py - Locate all crypto across portfolios
   - Scans all 49 accounts
   - Groups holdings by portfolio
   - Shows platform type (ADVANCED_TRADE vs CONSUMER)
   - Identifies where holdings are located

✅ test_api_connection.py - Validate API credentials
   - Simpler version of debug_api.py
   - Shows any crypto holdings with positive balance
   - Helps identify which accounts have funds

✅ check_advanced_trade.py - Advanced Trade portfolio analysis
   - Filters accounts by platform type
   - Separates Advanced Trade from Consumer wallets
   - Shows available balance vs hold balance
   - Reports total crypto positions found

INVESTIGATION RESULTS:
- All API tests confirm: No crypto visible with this API key
- All accounts show $0 balance across 49 wallets
- No holdings detected in Advanced Trade platform
- Conclusion: Holdings are either:
  1. In a DIFFERENT Coinbase account (different API key needed)
  2. In Consumer wallet (needs transfer to Advanced Trade)
  3. Already sold/transferred elsewhere
  4. Visible only in Coinbase web interface

NEXT STEP:
User must verify in Coinbase web interface:
- Login to coinbase.com
- Check both "Spot Wallet" (Advanced Trade) and "Wallet" (Consumer)
- Confirm location and total value of 11 crypto holdings
- Provide API key for the correct account if necessary
