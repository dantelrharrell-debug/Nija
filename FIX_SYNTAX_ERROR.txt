Fix IndentationError: Remove orphaned logger statements

Issue: Previous fix introduced misaligned logger statements at lines 2449-2451
- Lines were left from earlier code refactoring
- Caused "unexpected indent" error preventing bot startup

Fix:
- Remove orphaned logger.warning() and logger.info() lines
- Clean up indentation in CLOSE_EXCESS_POSITIONS block
- Restore proper control flow

Result: Bot should start cleanly on next deployment
