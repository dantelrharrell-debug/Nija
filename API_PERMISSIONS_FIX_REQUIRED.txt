🔍 API Permissions Issue Identified - Holdings Not Visible

DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS:
✅ API key connects successfully
✅ Can fetch market prices (BTC, ETH, DOGE prices retrieved)
✅ Can execute trades (19 buys + 1 sell detected)
❌ Cannot see account holdings (0 crypto returned by get_accounts)

ROOT CAUSE:
API key has TRADING permissions but NOT VIEWING permissions
The key can trade but cannot read account balances/holdings

SYMPTOMS:
- Web interface shows 10 crypto positions
- API shows $0 balance and 0 positions
- Order history shows trades executed
- But no way to see current holdings via API

SOLUTION NEEDED:
User must update API key permissions in Coinbase settings:
1. Go to coinbase.com → Settings → API
2. Click on API key ending in 05067708
3. Check/enable these permissions:
   ✅ account:read (view balances)
   ✅ wallet:read (view holdings)  
   ✅ trade (place orders - already working)
4. Save changes
5. Test with: python3 check_nija_trading_status.py

Once permissions fixed:
- Bot will see all 10 positions
- Bot will manage stops/takes on them
- Position tracking will work correctly

FILES ADDED:
✅ debug_api_holdings.py - Diagnostic to identify permission issues
✅ Shows why web interface ≠ API visibility

This explains everything - the 10 crypto ARE there, 
but API can't see them due to limited key permissions.
