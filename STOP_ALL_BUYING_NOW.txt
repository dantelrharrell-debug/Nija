EMERGENCY STOP - ALL BUYING DISABLED
=====================================

Date: 2025-12-24
Reason: User request - bot kept buying after manual sell

CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED:
1. ✅ TRADING_EMERGENCY_STOP.conf file updated with emergency reason
2. ✅ Hard BUY block added to execute_trade() function
3. ✅ All running bot processes killed
4. ✅ Position limit checks reinforced

CURRENT STATUS:
- SELL-ONLY MODE: ACTIVE
- New BUY trades: BLOCKED
- Existing positions: Will be managed (stop loss/take profit)
- Manual sells: Will NOT trigger new buys

TO RESUME BUYING:
1. User must explicitly request it
2. Delete TRADING_EMERGENCY_STOP.conf file
3. Restart bot

DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE OR REMOVE THE LOCKFILE WITHOUT USER PERMISSION
