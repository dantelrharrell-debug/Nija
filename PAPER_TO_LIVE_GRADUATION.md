class Level2CircuitBreakers:
    # 3 consecutive losses
    if consecutive_losses >= 3:
        halt_trading(duration="24 hours", reason="Consecutive losses")
        notify_user("Circuit breaker triggered: 3 losses in a row")
    
    # 10% drawdown in 24 hours
    if account_drawdown_24h >= 0.10:
        halt_trading(duration="48 hours", reason="Rapid drawdown")
        notify_user("Account protection: 10% loss in 24 hours")
    
    # Daily loss limit
    if daily_loss >= 250:  # $250 USD
        halt_trading(duration="24 hours", reason="Daily limit")
        notify_user("Daily loss limit reached: $250")
    
    # Weekly loss limit
    if weekly_loss >= 500:  # $500 USD
        halt_trading(duration="7 days", reason="Weekly limit")
        require_review("Excessive losses - review required before re-enabling")
```

**Level 3 (Full Live)**:
```python
class Level3CircuitBreakers:
    # 15% monthly loss
    if monthly_loss_pct >= 0.15:
        reduce_limits(factor=0.5, duration="30 days")
        notify_user("Monthly loss threshold: Limits reduced by 50%")
    
    # 25% monthly loss (severe)
    if monthly_loss_pct >= 0.25:
        downgrade_to_level2(duration="90 days")
        require_compliance_review()
        notify_user("Downgraded to Level 2 due to excessive losses")
    
    # Rapid loss (5% in 1 hour)
    if hourly_loss_pct >= 0.05:
        halt_trading(duration="1 hour", reason="Rapid loss protection")
        require_manual_override_to_resume()
```

### Mandatory Cooling-Off Periods

    # After large loss (>20% account value)
    large_loss_cooloff = 3 * 24 * 3600  # 3 days mandatory break
    
    # After 5 consecutive losses
    streak_loss_cooloff = 24 * 3600  # 24 hours
    
    # After manual kill switch activation
    kill_switch_cooloff = 7 * 24 * 3600  # 7 days
```

### Position Size Limits with Progressive Unlocking

```python
class PositionSizeLimits:
    def get_max_position_size(user_level, account_value, months_trading):
        if user_level == 1:  # Paper
            return account_value * 0.20  # 20% per trade (learning)
        
        elif user_level == 2:  # Limited Live
            return min(500, account_value * 0.10)  # $500 or 10%
        
        elif user_level == 3:  # Full Live
            if months_trading < 3:
                return min(10000, account_value * 0.20)
            elif months_trading < 6:
                return min(50000, account_value * 0.20)
            elif months_trading < 12:
                return min(200000, account_value * 0.20)
