✅ Final API Credentials Cleanup - Single Source of Truth

CREDENTIALS CONSOLIDATED:
✅ Confirmed correct API credentials for dantelrharrell@gmail.com
✅ Updated .env with proper formatting (actual newlines, not \n escapes)
✅ Verified no duplicate or conflicting API keys in codebase
✅ Single source of truth established

API KEY INFO:
- Account: dantelrharrell@gmail.com
- API Key: organizations/ce77e4ea-ecca-42ec-912a-b6b4455ab9d0/apiKeys/05067708-2a5d-43a5-a4c6-732176c05e7c
- Format: EC Private Key (properly formatted with real newlines)

NEW TOOLS ADDED:
✅ check_nija_trading_status.py - Comprehensive trading health check
✅ import_existing_positions.py - Import orphaned positions to tracking
✅ TRANSFER_FUNDS_INSTRUCTIONS.py - Portfolio management guide
✅ COMMIT_MESSAGE_POSITION_TOOLS.txt - Documentation

WHAT THIS FIXES:
- All confusion about multiple API keys is resolved
- Bot now uses ONE set of credentials consistently
- No more "wrong portfolio" issues from credential mismatch
- Clear documentation of which account these keys access

TESTING REQUIRED:
After this commit, user should:
1. Verify crypto holdings are visible via API
2. Confirm bot can see positions and cash balance
3. Test that sells execute when exit conditions hit
4. Monitor first few trades to ensure proper tracking

This establishes clean baseline - one account, one set of API keys, consistent access.
