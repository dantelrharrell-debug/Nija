QUESTION: Is NIJA connected and trading on Kraken now for the master and users?

ANSWER: NO ❌

Kraken is NOT connected and NOT trading for any account (master or users) because API credentials are not configured.

DETAILS:
- Master Account: ❌ NOT connected to Kraken (missing KRAKEN_MASTER_API_KEY and KRAKEN_MASTER_API_SECRET)
- User #1 (Daivon Frazier): ❌ NOT connected to Kraken (missing KRAKEN_USER_DAIVON_API_KEY and KRAKEN_USER_DAIVON_API_SECRET)
- User #2 (Tania Gilbert): ❌ NOT connected to Kraken (missing KRAKEN_USER_TANIA_API_KEY and KRAKEN_USER_TANIA_API_SECRET)

WHY:
The code infrastructure is fully implemented and ready, but the required Kraken API credentials have not been set in environment variables.

IMPACT:
- Bot runs successfully without errors
- Trading continues on other exchanges (Coinbase, Alpaca)
- Kraken trading is skipped silently with warning messages in logs
- NO trades are executed on Kraken

TO ENABLE KRAKEN:
1. Get API keys from https://www.kraken.com/u/security/api (for all 3 accounts)
2. Set environment variables (see KRAKEN_TRADING_STATUS.md for details)
3. Restart bot
4. Verify with: python3 check_kraken_status.py

ESTIMATED TIME TO ENABLE: ~60 minutes
