## 📋 WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE NEXT

### Phase 1: Integration (2-3 days)

**1. Integrate Risk Disclaimers into App**
```html
<!-- Add to frontend/templates/index.html, before </body> -->
<script src="/static/js/risk-disclaimers.js"></script>
<script>
  // Initialize on page load
  document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', async function() {
    const acknowledged = await NijaDisclaimers.initializeDisclaimers();
    if (!acknowledged) {
      // User didn't acknowledge - handle appropriately
      console.error('User must acknowledge risks');
    }
  });
</script>
```

**2. Test Onboarding Flow**
- [ ] Fresh install test (delete app + reinstall)
- [ ] Verify disclaimer shows on first launch
- [ ] Verify cannot skip disclaimer
- [ ] Verify all 6 checkboxes work
- [ ] Verify education mode banner appears
- [ ] Verify "Not Real Money" indicators visible

**3. Connect Simulation API to Frontend**
```javascript
// Example: Fetch simulation dashboard
async function loadSimulationDashboard() {
  const response = await fetch('/api/mobile/simulation/dashboard', {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${localStorage.getItem('auth_token')}`
    }
  });
  const data = await response.json();
  // Update UI with data.balance, data.performance, etc.
}
```

### Phase 2: Testing (3-4 days)

## ⚠️ CRITICAL REJECTION RISKS & MITIGATIONS

### Risk #1: Missing Risk Disclaimers
**Impact**: Instant rejection (Apple §2.5.6, Google Financial Services Policy)

**Mitigation**:
- ✅ Comprehensive disclaimers created
- ⏳ Must integrate into app startup
- ⏳ Must show BEFORE any functionality
- ⏳ Cannot be skipped

**Verification**:
```bash
# Run test suite
python test_pre_submission.py

# Should show:
# ✅ Onboarding disclaimers contains required content
```

### Risk #2: No Demo Access for Reviewers
**Impact**: Rejection - "Cannot test app without credentials"

**Mitigation**:
- ✅ Education mode is default (no credentials needed)
- ⏳ Add clear reviewer notes explaining education mode
- ⏳ Provide demo account OR explain no login needed

**Reviewer Notes Template** (use this):
```
App starts in Education Mode automatically.
No credentials needed to test features.
$10,000 simulated balance provided.
All trades are simulated (no real money).

To test:
1. Complete onboarding
2. Explore education mode (default)
3. No broker connection required
```

### Risk #3: Guaranteed Profit Claims
**Impact**: Instant rejection

**Mitigation**:
- ✅ Test suite checks for prohibited terms
- ✅ No "guaranteed profit" language found
- ⏳ Manual review of all app text
- ⏳ Manual review of screenshots

**Prohibited Terms** (never use):
- "guaranteed profit"
- "always profitable"
- "never lose"
- "simulated"
- "100% win rate"

### Risk #4: Insufficient Privacy Policy
**Impact**: Rejection (both stores require privacy policy for Finance apps)

**Mitigation**:
- ✅ Privacy policy exists: `mobile/PRIVACY_POLICY.md`
- ⏳ Must publish at public URL
- ⏳ Add URL to both store listings

**Requirements**:
- What data is collected
- Why it's collected
- How it's used
- Who it's shared with (none for NIJA)
- How users can delete data

### Risk #5: App Crashes on Launch
**Impact**: Instant rejection

**Mitigation**:
- ⏳ Fresh install testing on real devices
- ⏳ Test on minimum supported OS versions
- ⏳ Test with no network connection
- ⏳ Test with no .env file

**Test Procedure**:
1. Delete app
2. Reinstall from TestFlight/Internal Track
3. Launch app
4. Verify no crash
5. Complete onboarding
6. Verify all features work
