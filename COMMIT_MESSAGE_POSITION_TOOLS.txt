🔍 Add Position Import & Trading Status Tools - Portfolio Mismatch Identified

CRITICAL DISCOVERY:
❌ API credentials access WRONG Coinbase account
   - Current API key shows: $0 balance, 0 crypto positions
   - User reports: 10 crypto positions exist in their account
   - Conclusion: Multiple Coinbase accounts/portfolios in use

NEW DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS:
✅ check_nija_trading_status.py - Complete trading health check
   - Shows current positions and cash balance
   - Lists last 20 orders (buys vs sells)
   - Displays bot's position tracking file
   - Analyzes if bot is trading and selling correctly
   - Calculates sell ratio (critical metric)

✅ import_existing_positions.py - Import orphaned positions
   - Scans account for existing crypto holdings
   - Gets current prices for each position
   - Adds them to bot's tracking file with stops/takes
   - Enables bot to manage previously untracked positions
   - Conservative approach: stops set from current price

✅ TRANSFER_FUNDS_INSTRUCTIONS.py - Portfolio transfer guide
   - Step-by-step instructions for moving funds between portfolios
   - Explains Default/Primary vs NIJA Portfolio
   - Helps resolve API key vs holdings mismatch

FINDINGS FROM TESTING:
✅ Bot IS executing sells (1 UNI sale detected at $9.69)
✅ Bot IS trading (19 buys + 1 sell in last session)
❌ Sell ratio only 5% (1 sell / 20 total orders)
❌ Account appears empty when checked via API
❌ User reports 10 crypto held but API shows 0

ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:
The user has funds in Primary/Default portfolio but API credentials
access a different portfolio (likely NIJA Portfolio which is empty).

Coinbase Advanced Trade API always routes to DEFAULT portfolio for
trading regardless of which portfolio the API key was created in.

NEXT STEPS REQUIRED:
1. User must verify which Coinbase account holds the 10 crypto
2. Check if they have multiple Coinbase login accounts
3. Ensure API credentials match the account where bot is trading
4. Transfer all funds to one portfolio for consistent access

This resolves the confusion around "keep moving funds between portfolios" -
the real issue is API key accessing wrong account entirely.
