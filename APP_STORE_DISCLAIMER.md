## Legal Disclaimers for Terms of Service

### Independent Trading Disclosure
```
SECTION: INDEPENDENT TRADING MODEL

NIJA operates using an independent trading model. Each connected account 
trades independently using the same NIJA trading algorithm. The system does 
NOT copy, mirror, or replicate trades from one account to another.

Specifically:
a) Each account analyzes market data independently
b) Each account makes its own trading decisions based on the same algorithm
c) Each account executes trades at its own timing
d) Position sizes are calculated independently based on each account's balance
e) No account has control over or influence on other accounts
f) There is no "platform account" or "follower account" structure
g) Trade signals are NOT transmitted between accounts
h) The timing and exact trades may differ between accounts due to:
   - Network latency
   - API response times  
   - Account balance differences
   - Existing position differences
   - Natural timing variation in market scanning

Users acknowledge and agree that:
- Accounts trade independently, not by copying
- Each account is responsible for its own trading results
- Similar trades across accounts result from using the same algorithm, not copying
- No account receives preferential treatment or information
