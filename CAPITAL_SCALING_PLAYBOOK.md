## Overview

NIJA's capital scaling system is designed to **adapt your trading strategy to your current account size**, maximizing profitability while protecting capital. The bot automatically adjusts:

- **Position sizes** based on available capital
- **Risk levels** appropriate for your tier
- **Number of concurrent positions** to optimize capital efficiency
- **Profit targets** that account for fees at each capital level

### Key Principles

1. **Never risk more than you can afford to lose** - Each tier has maximum loss limits
2. **Fees matter more at smaller account sizes** - Minimum position sizes ensure fee-adjusted profitability
3. **Compound gains, not losses** - Withdraw profits regularly once targets are met
4. **Patience and discipline** - Each tier requires time; rushing leads to losses

## Position Sizing Rules

### General Formula

```
Position Size = Account Balance × Tier Percentage × Quality Multiplier
```

**Quality Multiplier** adjusts based on:
- Signal strength (1-5): Higher = larger position
- Market volatility: Lower volatility = larger position
- Win streak: Winning streak = modest increase
- Loss streak: Losing streak = significant decrease

### Minimum Position Sizes (Fee-Adjusted)

| Tier | Min Position | Reason |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Tier 1 ($10-50) | $5 | Coinbase fees ~1.4%, need 2%+ gain for profit |
| Tier 2 ($50-200) | $8 | Better fee ratio, easier profitability |
| Tier 3 ($200-1K) | $15 | Optimal fee efficiency |
| Tier 4 ($1K-5K) | $25 | Professional minimum |
| Tier 5 ($5K-20K) | $50 | Institutional sizing |
| Tier 6 ($20K+) | $100 | Elite sizing |

### Maximum Position Sizes

**Never exceed**:
- Single position: 25% of account balance
- Total exposure: 95% of account balance
- Daily risk: 15% of account balance

## Risk Management Parameters

### Stop Loss Rules

1. **Technical Stop**: Based on swing low/high + ATR buffer
2. **Percentage Stop**: Fixed % below entry (tier-specific)

1. Technical breakdown (RSI < 30 for longs)
2. Percentage threshold (-2% for most tiers)
3. Opposite signal (strategy reversal)

### Daily Stop Loss (Circuit Breaker)

**Daily Limits by Tier**:
- Tier 1: -5% daily
- Tier 2: -6% daily
- Tier 3: -8% daily
- Tier 4: -10% daily
- Tier 5: -12% daily

## Compound Growth Strategy

### The Power of Compounding

**Example: Starting with $100**

| Month | Balance | Daily Target | Daily Income | Monthly Growth |
|-------|---------|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| 1 | $100 | 5% | $5 | → $150 |
| 2 | $150 | 5% | $7.50 | → $225 |
| 3 | $225 | 5% | $11.25 | → $337 |
| 4 | $337 | 4% | $13.48 | → $472 |
| 5 | $472 | 4% | $18.88 | → $661 |
| 6 | $661 | 3% | $19.83 | → $854 |
| 7 | $854 | 3% | $25.62 | → $1,103 |
| 8 | $1,103 | 3% | $33.09 | → $1,424 |
| 9 | $1,424 | 2% | $28.48 | → $1,778 |
| 10 | $1,778 | 2% | $35.56 | → $2,221 |
| 11 | $2,221 | 2% | $44.42 | → $2,776 |
| 12 | $2,776 | 2% | $55.52 | → $3,470 |

**Result**: $100 → $3,470 in one year (3,370% return)

### Withdrawal Strategy

**Never withdraw principal**, only profits:

**Tier 1-3**: Reinvest 100% (need to reach $1,000 minimum)

**Tier 4 ($1K-5K)**:
- Withdraw 20% of profits weekly
- Reinvest 80% for growth
- Goal: Reach $5,000 while taking $200-500 in profits

**Tier 5 ($5K-20K)**:
- Withdraw 50% of profits monthly
- Reinvest 50% for growth
- Goal: Reach $20,000 while taking $2,000-5,000 in profits

**Tier 6 ($20K+)**:
- Withdraw 60-80% of profits monthly
- Reinvest 20-40% for growth
- Goal: Sustainable $10,000-20,000/month income

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### Pitfall 1: Over-Trading (Too Many Positions)

**Problem**: Opening 20+ positions on small account, spreads capital too thin  
**Symptoms**: All positions < $5, high fees, low profit margins  
**Solution**:
- ✅ Respect tier position limits (3-5 for Tier 1, 8 for Tier 2, etc.)
- ✅ Close smallest positions if over limit
- ✅ Focus on quality over quantity

### Pitfall 2: Under-Sizing Positions (Fee Death)

**Problem**: $1-2 positions get crushed by 1.4% Coinbase fees  
**Symptoms**: Winning trades but losing money, fees > profits  
**Solution**:
- ✅ Enforce minimum position sizes ($5 for Tier 1, $8 for Tier 2, etc.)
- ✅ Consider switching to lower-fee exchanges (Binance 0.1%, OKX 0.08%)
- ✅ Never trade if balance < tier minimum

### Pitfall 3: Ignoring Stop Losses (Bleeding Capital)

**Problem**: Holding losing positions "hoping they recover"  
**Symptoms**: Positions down -10%, -20%, account shrinking  
**Solution**:
- ✅ Enforce automatic stop losses at -2%
- ✅ Never override stop loss manually
- ✅ Accept small losses to prevent large ones

### Pitfall 4: Chasing Losses (Revenge Trading)

**Problem**: Trying to recover losses with bigger, riskier trades  
**Symptoms**: Position sizes increase after losses, win rate drops  
**Solution**:
- ✅ Reduce position size by 30% after each loss
- ✅ Activate daily stop loss circuit breaker
- ✅ Take 24h break after 3 consecutive losses

### Pitfall 5: Moving Up Tiers Too Fast

**Problem**: Jumping from Tier 1 to Tier 3 rules prematurely  
**Symptoms**: Violating risk limits, overleveraged, blowup risk  
**Solution**:
- ✅ NIJA automatically selects tier based on balance
- ✅ Never manually override tier settings
- ✅ Let compounding naturally move you up tiers

### Pitfall 6: Not Adapting to Market Conditions

**Problem**: Using same strategy in trending vs choppy markets  
**Symptoms**: High win rate in trends, losses in chop  
**Solution**:
- ✅ NIJA adapts automatically (market regime detection)
- ✅ Reduce trading in choppy/low-volume periods
- ✅ Increase trading in strong trends

### Pitfall 7: Forgetting About Taxes

**Problem**: Trading profits without setting aside tax reserves  
**Symptoms**: Owing taxes on money already reinvested/lost  
**Solution**:
- ✅ Set aside 25-35% of profits for taxes (US)
- ✅ Track all trades in journal
- ✅ Consult tax professional for crypto trading
