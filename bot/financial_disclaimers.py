CRYPTOCURRENCY TRADING INVOLVES SUBSTANTIAL RISK OF LOSS

⚠️  YOU CAN LOSE MONEY:
   • Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile
   • Past performance does NOT indicate future results
   • You can lose some or ALL of your invested capital
   • Only trade with money you can afford to lose

🤖 ABOUT THIS SOFTWARE:
   • NIJA is an independent trading tool - NOT investment advice
   • You make all decisions about when and what to trade
   • This software executes trades based on YOUR configuration
   • NO GUARANTEES of profit or performance are made

📊 INDEPENDENT TRADING MODEL:
   • Each account trades independently using algorithmic signals
   • No copy trading or signal distribution to other users
   • Each user controls their own trading strategy and risk
   • Your results are based on YOUR account's performance

🛡️  YOUR RESPONSIBILITY:
   • You are solely responsible for your trading decisions
   • You control when trading is enabled or disabled
   • You set your own risk parameters and position sizes
   • Consult a licensed financial advisor before trading

By using this software, you acknowledge that you understand and accept
these risks. NIJA and its developers are not liable for any trading losses.

╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

WHAT IS INDEPENDENT TRADING?

✅ EACH account trades INDEPENDENTLY:
   • Your account evaluates market conditions independently
   • Your trades are based on YOUR account's algorithmic analysis
   • NO copying of trades from other users
   • NO master account controlling your trades
   • NO signal distribution or coordination between accounts

🔒 COMPLETE ISOLATION:
   • Your profits/losses are YOUR OWN
   • Other users' performance does NOT affect you
   • Each account has its own risk management
   • Each account makes its own trading decisions

🤖 HOW IT WORKS:
   • All accounts use the SAME trading algorithm/strategy
   • Each account independently applies this algorithm
   • Market conditions may trigger similar trades across accounts
   • But each account's execution is INDEPENDENT

💡 THINK OF IT LIKE:
   • Multiple people using the same weather app
   • They all see the same forecast (algorithm)
   • But each person decides independently what to do about it
   • No one is copying anyone else's decisions
