## 🚀 Quick Start for Development

### Running the Graduation System

```python
from bot.graduation_system import GraduationSystem, TradingLevel

# Initialize system
grad_system = GraduationSystem()

# Check if user can graduate from Level 1
performance = {
    "win_rate": 0.583,
    "sharpe_ratio": 1.42,
    "max_drawdown": 0.087,
    "total_trades": 127,
    "profit_factor": 1.67,
    "avg_rr": 1.83,
    "knowledge_test_score": 0.92,
    "risk_education_completed": True,
    "trading_days": 47
}

eligible, reason, missing = grad_system.check_level1_graduation_eligibility(
    user_id="user_123",
    performance_data=performance
)

print(f"Eligible: {eligible}")
print(f"Reason: {reason}")

# Get user's current limits
limits = grad_system.get_user_limits(
    user_id="user_123",
    level=TradingLevel.LIMITED_LIVE,
    months_at_level=0
)

print(f"Max account: ${limits.max_account_value:,.0f}")
print(f"Max position: ${limits.max_position_size:,.0f}")
```

### Key Classes

**TradingLevel** (Enum):
- `PAPER` = 1
- `LIMITED_LIVE` = 2
- `FULL_LIVE` = 3

**LevelLimits** (Dataclass):
- `max_account_value`: float
- `max_position_size`: float
- `max_open_positions`: int
- `daily_loss_limit`: Optional[float]
- `daily_trade_limit`: int
- `leverage_allowed`: bool

**GraduationSystem** (Main Class):
- `check_level1_graduation_eligibility()`: Check paper → live
- `check_level2_graduation_eligibility()`: Check limited → full
- `progressive_limit_unlock()`: Calculate current limits
- `apply_circuit_breaker()`: Halt trading when triggered
- `downgrade_user()`: Move user to lower level

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"User stuck in Level 1 despite meeting criteria"**
- Check all 9 criteria are met (use `check_level1_graduation_eligibility()`)
- Verify `trading_days >= 30`
- Confirm knowledge test score >= 80%

**"Circuit breaker triggering too often"**
- Review thresholds in `LEVEL_2_LIMITS` and `LEVEL_3_LIMITS`
- Analyze logs to identify false positives
- Adjust thresholds if justified (document reason)

**"KYC verification failing"**
- Check document quality (readable, not expired)
- Verify face matching threshold (default: 85%)
- Review third-party KYC provider logs

**"Progressive unlocking not increasing limits"**
- Confirm `months_at_level` calculated correctly
- Check performance gates met (in `PerformanceGates`)
- Verify no circuit breaker violations in window

### Debug Mode

Enable verbose logging:
```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

grad_system = GraduationSystem()
# Now all internal checks will be logged
```
