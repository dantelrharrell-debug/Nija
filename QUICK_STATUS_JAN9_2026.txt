================================================================================
                        ISSUES FOUND & FIXED
================================================================================

❌ PROBLEM: Rate Limiting Errors
   - HTTP 429: Too Many Requests
   - HTTP 403: Forbidden "Too many errors"
   - API key getting temporarily blocked
   - 2-3 minute recovery time with multiple retries

✅ SOLUTION: Comprehensive Rate Limit Fixes (THIS PR)
   
   1. Increased delays (2.0s → 3.0s)
      → Request rate: 0.33/s (ultra-safe)
   
   2. Pre-delay before API calls (CRITICAL)
      → No more rapid-fire requests
   
   3. Longer startup delay (30s → 45s)
      → API fully resets before scanning
   
   4. Circuit breakers added
      → Stop after 3 consecutive errors
      → Stop after 5 total errors
   
   5. Better error recovery (5s → 8s)
      → API has more time to recover
