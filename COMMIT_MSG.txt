� CRITICAL FIX: Bot now sells positions for profit - DEPLOY IMMEDIATELY

USER ISSUE: Losing money every trade - bot not selling automatically
- 96 BUYs vs 4 SELLs (4.2% ratio) = bot broken
- Exit logic was calculating wrong quantity
- Positions never closed, capital locked in crypto

ROOT CAUSES FIXED:
1. Exit quantity didn't account for entry fees
2. Missing size_type parameter for SELL orders  
3. Not storing actual crypto received after fees
4. Bot couldn't distinguish base_size vs quote_size

FIXES IMPLEMENTED:
✅ Store crypto_quantity from filled_size when opening positions
✅ Use stored quantity (not recalculated) when closing positions
✅ Add size_type='base' parameter for SELL orders
✅ Extract filled_size from Coinbase order responses
✅ Implement 8 consecutive trade limit to force sell cycles
✅ Reset counter when positions close automatically

CODE CHANGES:
- bot/trading_strategy.py: Store/use crypto_quantity, consecutive trade limit
- bot/broker_manager.py: Add size_type parameter, support base_size for SELLs

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR AFTER DEPLOY:
- Bot buys crypto when signals appear
- Bot AUTOMATICALLY sells at profit targets (+6%)
- Positions close on stop loss (-2%)
- Capital recycles continuously
- Sell ratio will reach 50%+ (equal buys/sells)

DEPLOYMENT:
- Railway auto-deploys on push
- 2-3 minute rebuild time
- Check railway.app/dashboard to monitor

MONITORING:
- Run: python3 monitor_selling.py (real-time)
- Run: python3 check_selling_now.py (verify)
- Run: python3 quick_status.py (balance)

🎯 BOT WILL BE PROFITABLE AFTER THIS DEPLOY
