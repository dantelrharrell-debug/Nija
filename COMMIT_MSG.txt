Add multi-strategy entry system and enhanced trend-riding exit logic

Entry System:
- Dual RSI strategy: momentum breakouts OR pullback/mean reversion
- Longs now catch both rising RSI and healthy pullbacks (RSI 30-70 cooling in uptrend)
- Shorts catch both falling RSI and bounces in downtrend
- Enables trading every opportunity - up or down, every penny counts
- Changed from requiring ALL 5 conditions to just 2/5 for entry
- Reduced volume requirement from 100% to 50% of previous 2 candles
- Relaxed no-trade RSI zones from 90/10 to 95/5

Exit System - Ride Trends to Peak:
- Looser trailing stops: 0.3-1.2% trails (vs old 0.1-0.25%) to let winners run
- Advanced peak detection: requires 2+ confluence signals (pullback, RSI divergence, volume decline, VWAP shift)
- No arbitrary profit caps: holds strong trends to 5%+ instead of exiting at 2%
- Momentum-based holding: keeps position if RSI favorable and volume strong
- Tracks peak price and only exits on confirmed trend exhaustion

This allows NIJA to enter more frequently AND hold winning trades through entire trends to actual peaks.

Technical fixes:
- Fixed pandas FutureWarning for to_datetime with numeric conversion
- Added visual ✅/❌ indicators for condition feedback
