# THREE GUARDRAILS - BULLETPROOF AUDITS

## Executive Summary

Added three final guardrails to make NIJA bulletproof for production and audits:

1. **Meaningful Profit Metric** - Strategy quality tracking
2. **Hard Drawdown Circuit Breaker** - Survival mechanism
3. **Integration Complete** - All systems working together

These guardrails complement the existing profit gates and make audits bulletproof.

## Guardrail 1: Meaningful Profit Metric

### The Problem
**Technically True but Strategically Useless**
- P&L > 0 = WIN (correct philosophically)
- But a $0.01 win on $0.10 fees is technically true yet strategically worthless

### The Solution
**Secondary Metric for Internal Discipline**
```
MEANINGFUL_PROFIT = net_pnl >= (2 × fees)
```

**Example**:
- $0.20 profit on $0.10 fees → **MEANINGFUL_WIN** ✅
- $0.15 profit on $0.10 fees → WIN but not meaningful
- $0.01 profit on $0.10 fees → WIN but not meaningful

### Implementation
```python
# Truth (always tracked)
if pnl_dollars > 0:
    outcome = 'win'
else:
    outcome = 'loss'

# Quality (internal discipline)
meaningful_win = (pnl_dollars >= 2 * total_fees) if outcome == 'win' else False
```

### Key Points
- **Keep**: WIN/LOSS (truth)
- **Track separately**: MEANINGFUL_WIN (strategy quality)
- **Do NOT expose to users** - internal discipline only
- **Why**: Improves strategy without lying to users

### Metrics Added
- `meaningful_wins` - Count of meaningful wins
- `meaningful_win_rate` - Percentage of trades that are meaningful wins
- Tracked in `bot/trade_journal.py`

## Guardrail 2: Hard Drawdown Circuit Breaker

### The Problem
**Need to Survive Bad Market Regimes**
- Aggression reduction is good but not enough
- Need a hard stop when things go really bad

### The Solution
**Circuit Breaker at -3% in 24h**
```
If 24h net PnL <= -3%:
  → NEW ENTRIES PAUSED
  → EXITS ONLY
  → Auto-reset on profitability
```

### Why -3%?
- Simple but effective
- Not too sensitive (avoids noise)
- Not too loose (protects capital)
- Survives bad market regimes

### Implementation
```python
class NIJAHealthMetric:
    CIRCUIT_BREAKER_PCT = 3.0  # -3% triggers pause
    
    def should_allow_new_entry(self) -> tuple[bool, str]:
        if self.circuit_breaker_active:
            return False, "Circuit breaker active: 24h loss >= 3%, NEW ENTRIES PAUSED"
        return True, "OK"
```

### Usage Example
```python
# Before entering new trade
health = NIJAHealthMetric()
allowed, reason = health.should_allow_new_entry()

if not allowed:
    logger.error(f"🧯 CIRCUIT BREAKER: {reason}")
    # Process exits only
    return False

# Normal trading
execute_entry(signal)
```

### Logging
When triggered:
```
============================================================
🧯 CIRCUIT BREAKER ACTIVATED
============================================================
24h Loss: -3.25% (threshold: -3.0%)
NEW ENTRIES PAUSED - EXITS ONLY
Triggered at: 2026-02-05 12:45:00
This protects capital during bad market regimes
============================================================
```

When reset:
```
============================================================
✅ CIRCUIT BREAKER RESET
============================================================
24h Profit: +1.15%
NEW ENTRIES RESUMED
============================================================
```

### Key Points
- **Automatic trigger** at -3% 24h loss
- **Automatic reset** on profitability
- **Clear logging** with 🧯 emoji
- **Exits still allowed** - capital preservation

## Test Results

### Guardrail 1: Meaningful Profit
```
✅ PASS: $0.20 profit on $0.10 fees → meaningful=True
✅ PASS: $0.15 profit on $0.10 fees → meaningful=False
✅ PASS: $0.01 profit on $0.10 fees → meaningful=False
✅ PASS: $0.50 profit on $0.10 fees → meaningful=True

✅ Guardrail 1: Working
   - WIN/LOSS remains truthful
   - MEANINGFUL_WIN tracks quality
   - Internal discipline only
```

### Guardrail 2: Circuit Breaker
```
Test 1: Normal (+1% profit)
  Circuit breaker: False
  New entries: Allowed

Test 2: Trigger (-3% loss)
  Circuit breaker: True
  New entries: PAUSED
  Reason: "24h loss >= 3%, NEW ENTRIES PAUSED"

Test 3: Recovery (+1% profit)
  Circuit breaker: False
  New entries: Allowed (auto-reset)

✅ Guardrail 2: Working
   - Triggers at -3%
   - Pauses new entries
   - Allows exits
   - Auto-resets
```

## Production Recommendations

### Do NOT Market as "Profitable"
**Instead market as:**
- ✅ "Capital-protected"
- ✅ "Honesty-first"
- ✅ "Production-ready"
- ✅ "Bulletproof audits"

**This is actually stronger positioning.**

### Why?
1. **Capital-protected** → Circuit breaker survives bad regimes
2. **Honesty-first** → No neutral outcomes, truthful accounting
3. **Production-ready** → All guardrails in place
4. **Bulletproof audits** → Meaningful profit tracking, clear logs

---

## Release Recommendation

### Tag as v0.9.0 - Discipline & Truth Release
