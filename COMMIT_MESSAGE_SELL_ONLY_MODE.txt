Enable SELL-ONLY mode via TRADING_EMERGENCY_STOP.conf; keep auto-exits; no sells observed yet

Summary:
- Add sell-only operation when TRADING_EMERGENCY_STOP.conf exists:
  - Manage and close existing positions (SL/TP/Trailing/Opposite-signal)
  - Block new entries to stop bleed
- Preserve normal behavior when the lock is absent (entries allowed)
- Guard tweak: when balance is 0, skip only new entries; still manage exits

Files changed:
- bot/trading_strategy.py: implement sell-only in run_cycle and run_trading_cycle
- TRADING_EMERGENCY_STOP.conf: added as the global kill switch file
- emergency_liquidate.py: robust error handling for get_accounts and helpful diagnostics

Operational notes:
- Lock currently enabled for safety; remove file to resume buys
- No sell events observed in logs yet at commit time; after restart, exits will trigger per rules

Next steps:
- Restart: python3 bot/live_trading.py
- Verify exits: tail -f nija.log | grep -E "Closing|Stop loss|Trailing stop|Take profit"
- Balance check: python3 check_balance_now.py
