## 📊 1. Profit Factor (MOST IMPORTANT)

**Formula:** Total Gross Profit ÷ Total Gross Loss

### Benchmarks

```
< 1.0  → Losing system ❌
1.2-1.4 → Barely profitable
1.5-2.0 → Professional-grade system ✅
2.0-3.0 → Elite AI system 🏆
> 3.0   → Often overfit (danger) ⚠️
```

### NIJA Target: **2.0 - 2.6**

**Why This Range?**

- ✅ **Maximizes compounding**: 2.0+ PF enables exponential growth
- ✅ **Controls risk**: Not overfitting like 3.0+ systems
- ✅ **Attracts investors**: Institutional-grade performance
- ✅ **Sustainable edge**: Long-term viability

**Implementation:**
- Conservative position sizing (2-5%)
- Strict entry filters (3/5+ signal conditions)
- Stepped profit-taking (0.5%, 1%, 2%, 3%)
- Wider stops (1.5x ATR) to reduce stop-hunts

---

## 🎯 2. Win Rate (Optimized - NOT Maximized)

**Formula:** Winning Trades ÷ Total Trades × 100

### Benchmarks

```
30-40% → Trend systems
40-50% → Institutional quant models ✅
50-60% → Elite automated systems 🏆
> 70%  → Usually martingale or fake edge ⚠️
```

### NIJA Target: **58% - 62%**

**Why NOT 70%+?**

High win rates (70%+) typically indicate:
- Martingale position sizing (dangerous)
- Overfitting to historical data
- Unsustainable edge
- Small wins, massive losses

**Why 58-62% is Optimal:**

- ✅ **Psychological confidence**: More wins than losses
- ✅ **Profitability**: Combined with 1:2 R:R = massive edge
- ✅ **Algorithmic stability**: Robust across market conditions
- ✅ **Investor appeal**: Retail + institutional comfort zone

**Implementation:**
- High-quality entry signals (3/5+ conditions required)
- Multi-stage profit-taking (lock in gains early)
- Trend-following bias (higher success in trends)
- Volume and volatility filters

---

## 💰 3. Average Loss Per Trade

**Formula:** Total Losses ÷ Number of Losing Trades

### Benchmarks

```
-2.0% → High risk
-1.0% → Standard retail
-0.6% → Professional ✅
-0.4% → Elite aggressive 🏆
```

### NIJA Target: **-0.4% to -0.7%**

**Why This Range?**

- ✅ **Fast compounding**: Small losses = quick recovery
- ✅ **Account longevity**: 100+ consecutive losses before ruin
- ✅ **High-frequency trading**: Enables more trades per day
- ✅ **Shallow drawdowns**: <12% max drawdown achievable

**Implementation:**
- **Stop Loss Method**: Swing low/high + 1.5x ATR
- **Min Stop**: 0.4% of account
- **Max Stop**: 0.7% of account
- **Optimal Stop**: 0.6% of account
- **Never widen**: Stops only tighten, never expand

---

## 📈 4. Risk:Reward Ratio (R:R)

**Formula:** Average Win ÷ Average Loss

### Benchmarks

```
1:1   → Break-even systems
1:1.8 → Strong ✅
1:2.5 → Elite 🏆
1:3+  → Usually trend-following only
```

### NIJA Target: **1:1.8 - 1:2.5**

**Why This Range?**

Combined with 60% win rate:
- ✅ Enables 2.0+ profit factor
- ✅ Supports rapid account growth
- ✅ Provides margin for slippage/fees
- ✅ Realistic for crypto volatility

**Example Trade:**
```
Entry: $100
Stop Loss: $99.40 (-0.6% risk = $0.60)
Take Profit: $101.20 (+1.2% reward = $1.20)
Risk:Reward: 1:2.0 ✅
```

**Implementation:**
- **Stepped exits** at 0.5%, 1.0%, 2.0%, 3.0%
- **Average win target**: 1.2% (optimal)
- **Trailing stops**: Activated at 2R (2.0% profit)
- **Never chase**: Accept 1:1.8 minimum, target 1:2.5

---

## 🧮 5. Expectancy (The Real Money Metric)

**Formula:** (Win Rate × Avg Win) - (Loss Rate × Avg Loss)

### Benchmarks

```
+$0.10 → Barely profitable
+$0.30 → Professional ✅
+$0.60 → Elite 🏆
+$1.00 → Exceptional (rare)
```

### NIJA Target: **+0.45R - +0.65R per trade**

**What This Means:**

For every $1 risked, NIJA expects to make $0.45 - $0.65 on average.

**Example Calculation:**
```
Win Rate: 60%
Avg Win: +1.2%
Avg Loss: -0.6%

Expectancy = (0.60 × 1.2) - (0.40 × 0.6)
           = 0.72 - 0.24
           = +0.48% per trade ✅
```

**Growth Implications:**

With 7 trades/day × 20 days/month:
```
Monthly Trades: 140
Expected Profit: 140 × 0.48% = 67.2% theoretical

Throttled (conservative): 15% monthly
Throttled (moderate): 20% monthly
Throttled (aggressive): 25% monthly
```

**Implementation:**
- Every trade must have positive expectancy
- Minimum 0.45R required to execute
- Auto-adjust if expectancy drops below target
- Real-time calculation before each trade

---

## 📉 6. Maximum Drawdown

**Formula:** Peak Equity - Trough Equity ÷ Peak Equity × 100

### NIJA Target: **<12%**

**Optimal:** 10% or less

**Why <12%?**

- ✅ **Capital preservation**: Recoverable with minimal psychological impact
- ✅ **Investor confidence**: Institutional investors typically require <15%
- ✅ **Risk management**: Indicates tight stop-loss discipline
- ✅ **Compounding protection**: Shallow drawdowns = faster recovery

**Implementation:**
- Max daily loss: 2.5%
- Position size caps: 5% max per trade
- Total exposure limit: 80%
- Hard stop at 8% drawdown (warning)
- Emergency shutdown at 12% drawdown

---

## 📐 7. Sharpe Ratio

**Formula:** (Return - Risk-Free Rate) ÷ Standard Deviation of Returns

### Benchmarks

```
< 1.0 → Suboptimal
1.2-1.5 → Acceptable ✅
> 1.8 → Elite 🏆
> 2.0 → Exceptional
```

### NIJA Target: **>1.8**

**Why Sharpe Ratio Matters:**

- Measures **risk-adjusted returns**
- Higher = better return per unit of risk
- Preferred metric for institutional investors
- Indicates strategy quality, not just returns

**Implementation:**
- Track daily returns volatility
- Calculate rolling 30-day Sharpe
- Alert if drops below 1.5
- Optimize for consistent returns, not home runs

---

## 🔄 8. Trading Frequency

### NIJA Target: **10 - 15 trades/day**

**Optimal:** 12 trades/day

**Why This Range?**

- ✅ **Consistent opportunity**: 10+ ensures meaningful daily profit potential
- ✅ **Quality over quantity**: 15 max prevents overtrading and fee drag
- ✅ **Fee efficiency**: Hard upper cap at 15/day keeps cumulative fees in check
- ✅ **Max-profit focus**: Only the top 35% of setups execute (TradeRankingEngine)

**Monthly Targets:**
```
Minimum: 200 trades (10/day × 20 days)
Target:  240 trades (12/day × 20 days)
Maximum: 300 trades (15/day × 20 days)
```

**Implementation:**
- **Adaptive frequency** via TradeFrequencyController (min=10, max=15 per day)
- Quality gate: TradeRankingEngine `pass_percentile=0.65` — top 35% only
- Score floor: `MIN_SCORE_ABSOLUTE=35` — weak signals rejected before ranking
- Loosen filters when below 10/day; tighten when above 15/day

---

## 🚀 Growth Targets

### Theoretical Maximum

With perfect execution:
```
Expectancy: 0.48% per trade
Trades/day: 7
Days/month: 20

Monthly Growth: 7 × 20 × 0.48% = 67.2% theoretical
Annual Growth: ~13,000% (unsustainable, will throttle)
```

### Realistic Targets (Throttled)

| Mode | Monthly | Annual (Compounded) |
|------|---------|---------------------|
| **Conservative** | 15% | 435% |
| **Moderate** | 20% | 791% |
| **Aggressive** | 25% | 1,455% |

**Throttling Mechanisms:**
- Position size reduction as account grows
- Trade frequency caps
- Maximum exposure limits
- Profit-taking priorities over position building

## 🎓 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Check Current Performance

```python
from bot.monitoring_system import PerformanceMetrics
from bot.elite_performance_config import validate_performance_targets

# Get current metrics
metrics = {
    'profit_factor': 2.3,
    'win_rate': 0.60,
    'avg_win_pct': 0.012,
    'avg_loss_pct': 0.006,
    'expectancy': 0.0048,
    'max_drawdown': 0.08,
}

# Validate against elite targets
is_elite, warnings = validate_performance_targets(metrics)

if is_elite:
    print("✅ ELITE PERFORMANCE - All targets met!")
else:
    print("⚠️ Performance issues:")
    for metric, warning in warnings.items():
        print(f"  - {metric}: {warning}")
```

### Example 2: Calculate Expectancy

```python
from bot.elite_performance_config import calculate_expectancy

win_rate = 0.60  # 60%
avg_win = 0.012  # 1.2%
avg_loss = 0.006  # 0.6%

expectancy = calculate_expectancy(win_rate, avg_win, avg_loss)
print(f"Expectancy: +{expectancy:.4f} ({expectancy*100:.2f}% per trade)")
# Output: Expectancy: +0.0048 (0.48% per trade)
```

### Example 3: Optimal Position Size

```python
from bot.elite_performance_config import get_optimal_position_size

adx = 28  # Good trend strength
signal_quality = 0.8  # 4/5 conditions met

position_size = get_optimal_position_size(adx, signal_quality)
print(f"Optimal position size: {position_size*100:.1f}%")
# Output: Optimal position size: 2.9%
```
