🎯 CHANGES COMPLETED - READY TO COMMIT & PUSH
==============================================

✅ CRITICAL CODE FIX APPLIED
────────────────────────────

FILE: bot/trading_strategy.py
LOCATION: run_trading_cycle() method (line ~1437)

WHAT WAS ADDED:
```python
# ✅ CRITICAL FIX: Manage open positions (close stops/takes/exits)
logger.info("📊 Checking open positions for exit conditions...")
self.manage_open_positions()
```

WHY THIS MATTERS:
• Positions were opening but NEVER closing
• Exit conditions were detected but NEVER executed
• Crypto was stuck in account, losing money daily
• This 3-line addition makes the position manager actually RUN

RESULT:
→ Every trading cycle now monitors open positions
→ Positions hit stop loss? AUTOMATICALLY SELLS
→ Positions hit take profit? AUTOMATICALLY SELLS
→ Position exits detected? AUTOMATICALLY CLOSES
→ No more orphaned coins bleeding value
