## Important Security Note ⚠️

**Your credentials are now in Git history (this PR).**

**After confirming deployment works:**

1. **Regenerate ALL API keys** on exchanges:
   - Coinbase: https://portal.cloud.coinbase.com/access/api
   - Kraken: https://www.kraken.com/u/security/api
   - Alpaca: https://app.alpaca.markets/paper/dashboard/overview

2. **Update environment variables** with new keys

3. **Revoke old keys** on exchanges

This ensures the exposed keys become unusable.
