Selling Logic Verification:
✅ Code analysis confirms selling IS implemented correctly:
  - Take profit: +6% (bot/trading_strategy.py line 646)
  - Stop loss: -2% (bot/trading_strategy.py line 645)
  - Trailing stops: 98% gain lock (lines 751-762)
  - Position management: lines 680-900
  - Retry logic: 3 attempts per order

Critical Findings:
❌ 30 BUY orders executed, 0 SELL orders found
❌ $94.92 spent, $0.00 cash remaining
❌ 0 crypto positions currently held
⚠️  Money unaccounted for - requires immediate investigation

Root Cause Analysis:
- Selling logic IS implemented in code ✅
- Problem is NOT the code - it's deployment/execution
- Bot may not be running continuously on Railway
- OR positions were sold manually outside bot
- OR bot crashed after buying, never monitored positions

Key Issue: Bot can only sell if it's actively running and monitoring.
Selling logic exists but requires continuous 24/7 execution to work.
