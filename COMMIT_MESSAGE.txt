Enable micro-capital trading: Lower minimum balance from $50 to $10

- Add MICRO_BALANCE tier ($10-50) with 90% position sizing
- Increase profit targets to 3.5% for micro accounts (accounts for higher fee ratios)
- Adjust get_position_size_pct() to support 4 balance tiers
- Update get_min_profit_target() to dynamically adjust based on account size
- Bot can now trade with balances as low as $10.67

This enables aggressive compounding from very small capital while
maintaining fee-aware position sizing to ensure profitability.

Changes to bot/fee_aware_config.py:
- MIN_BALANCE_TO_TRADE: $50 → $10
- New MICRO_BALANCE_THRESHOLD: $50
- New MICRO_BALANCE_POSITION_PCT: 90%
- New MICRO_BALANCE_MIN_PROFIT_TARGET: 3.5%
