Harden TradingStrategy init; add build signature; force rebuild

Fix: Use _os for env/path in __init__ to avoid local os shadowing that caused UnboundLocalError at startup.
Add: BUILD SIGNATURE log to verify the deployed image in Railway logs.
Chore: Bump Dockerfile CACHE_BUST to guarantee a fresh Railway rebuild.

Impact:
- Removes UnboundLocalError during TradingStrategy initialization.
- Provides clear log marker to confirm the running image version.
- Forces Railway to build and deploy the updated code.

Files:
- bot/trading_strategy.py
- Dockerfile
