Broker buy guard + sell-only hardening: block buys, prevent re-entry

Why:
- Bot was buying immediately after sells and during emergency stop; account bleeding persisted.

What changed:
- Add broker-layer BUY guard: blocks any BUY when TRADING_EMERGENCY_STOP.conf exists or HARD_BUY_OFF=1. [bot/broker_manager.py](bot/broker_manager.py#L792-L812)
- Disable auto-unlock of SELL-only mode unless ALLOW_AUTO_UNLOCK_SELL_ONLY=1 (manual-only lock). [bot/trading_strategy.py](bot/trading_strategy.py#L2265-L2290)
- Record recently_sold on every successful exit (normal/forced) to enforce cooldown and prevent immediate re-buys. [bot/trading_strategy.py](bot/trading_strategy.py#L1699-L1720), [bot/trading_strategy.py](bot/trading_strategy.py#L2060-L2070)

Operational notes:
- Set HARD_BUY_OFF=1 in Railway env to hard-disable buys at broker.
- Keep TRADING_EMERGENCY_STOP.conf present until you explicitly want to resume entries.
- Redeploy/restart service for changes to take effect.

Verification:
- Logs should show "BUY BLOCKED at broker layer" on any attempted buy.
- python check_bleeding_status.py and python monitor_selling.py should show 0 new buys.
