## 📞 REVIEWER SUPPORT

**Questions During Review:**
- Email: reviewer-support@nija.trading
- Response time: <24 hours
- Available for clarification calls

**Common Questions Answered:**

**Q: Can users lose money?**  
A: Yes. Trading involves risk, and users can lose their entire investment. This is clearly disclosed in multiple places before enabling live trading.

**Q: Does the app trade automatically?**  
A: Only if the user explicitly configures it to do so. Users define all strategy parameters, must acknowledge risks, and must manually enable trading. The app doesn't trade on its own.

**Q: Where are API credentials stored?**  
A: Locally on the user's device using platform-secure storage (iOS Keychain). Never transmitted to our servers.

**Q: Can this be used for gambling?**  
A: No. NIJA is a technical analysis tool for trading financial instruments on regulated exchanges. It requires user configuration, understanding, and active management.

**Q: What if the exchange goes down?**  
A: NIJA handles all failure modes gracefully (API outage, network loss, etc.) and never crashes. Trading automatically pauses, and the user is notified.
