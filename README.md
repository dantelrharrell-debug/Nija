## 🎯 Trading Strategy: Dual RSI System

### **Two RSI Indicators = Two Opportunity Types**

NIJA uses **RSI_9** (fast) and **RSI_14** (classic) to capture different market dynamics:

**1. Momentum Breakouts (RSI_9)**
- Detects rapid price acceleration early
- Entry when RSI_9 rising and < 80 (LONG) / falling and > 20 (SHORT)
- Captures strong directional moves before the crowd

**2. Pullback/Mean Reversion (RSI_14)**
- Identifies healthy pullbacks in established trends
- Entry when RSI_14 in 30-70 range and falling in uptrend (LONG)
- Buys dips in strong trends, avoiding overheated entries

### **Signal Scoring System**

Each potential trade is scored 0-5 based on these conditions:

1. **📊 VWAP Alignment**: Price above VWAP (LONG) or below (SHORT)
2. **📈 EMA Trend**: 9 EMA > 21 EMA > 50 EMA (LONG) / reverse for SHORT
3. **🎯 Dual RSI Favorable**: Either momentum OR pullback signal detected
4. **📢 Volume Confirmation**: Current volume ≥ 50% of recent average
5. **🕯️ Candle Close**: Bullish close for LONG, bearish for SHORT

**Entry Requirements**:
- **Minimum**: 2/5 conditions must be true
- **Position Sizing**: Higher scores = larger positions

| Score | Signal Quality | Position Size | Example |
|-------|---------------|---------------|---------|
| 5/5 | A+ Setup | 10% of account | Perfect pullback in strong uptrend |
| 4/5 | Strong | 6.8% of account | Most conditions aligned |
| 3/5 | Moderate | 4.4% of account | Valid setup, some confirmation missing |
| 2/5 | Minimum | 2.0% of account | Enough validation to enter |
| 0-1/5 | No Trade | 0% | Insufficient confirmation |

## 💰 Automatic Profit Compounding

**NIJA automatically compounds profits** without any configuration needed:

### **How It Works:**

1. **Before EVERY trade** → Bot calls `get_usd_balance()` to fetch current USD balance from Coinbase API
2. **Balance includes realized profits** → As positions close with profit, USD balance increases
3. **Position size calculated from current balance** → Next trade uses NEW higher balance
4. **Exponential growth** → Larger balance = larger positions = faster growth

**Example Compounding:**
```
Day 1: $100 balance → 5% position = $5.00 per trade
Day 5: $110 balance (after profits) → 5% position = $5.50 per trade
Day 10: $121 balance → 5% position = $6.05 per trade
Day 30: $150 balance → 5% position = $7.50 per trade
```

**Technical Implementation:**
- Line 170 in `trading_strategy.py`: `usd_balance = self.get_usd_balance()`
- Called inside `calculate_position_size()` before every entry
- NOT a stored variable - fetched fresh from API each time
- Ensures position sizing always uses most current account balance

**No configuration required** - compounding is built into the core system architecture.

## 📐 NIJA Trailing System (Position Management)

Advanced trailing system designed to **let winners run while protecting profits**:

### **Dynamic Trailing Stop-Loss (TSL)**

Adjusts based on profit level to give trends room to breathe:

| Profit Level | TSL Distance | Purpose |
|--------------|-------------|---------|
| +1% profit | 1.2% trailing | Initial protection |
| +2% profit | 1.0% trailing | Looser for trend continuation |
| +3% profit | 0.5% trailing | Standard trailing |
| +5%+ profit | 0.3% trailing | Tight protection of large gains |

### **Intelligent Partial Exits**

Locks profits progressively while letting runners maximize:

- **TP1 (+0.5%)**: Exit 50% of position → Lock initial gains
- **TP2 (+1.0%)**: Exit 25% of position → Capture momentum
- **Runner**: Final 25% trails with TSL → No cap, can run to 5%+ profits

### **Peak Detection System**

Monitors **5 reversal signals** to identify trend exhaustion:

1. Price pullback from recent peak (> 0.5%)
2. RSI divergence (price new high, RSI lower high)
3. RSI extreme reversal (RSI > 70 and falling)
4. VWAP breakdown (price crosses below VWAP)
5. Volume decline (< 70% of recent average)

**Exit Trigger**: When 2+ signals detected → Exit remaining position

### **EMA-21 Support Trailing**

- TSL trails 0.5% below EMA-21 (not tight to price)
- Prevents stop-outs on normal pullbacks
- Respects support levels during consolidation

---

## 🛡️ Risk Management & Safety Controls

### **1. Smart Burn-Down Mode**
- **Trigger**: 3 consecutive losses
- **Action**: Reduce position size to 2% for next 3 trades
- **Reset**: After 3 wins, return to normal sizing
- **Purpose**: Prevents capital bleed during losing streaks

### **2. Daily Profit Lock**
- **Trigger**: +3% daily profit achieved
- **Action**: Only take A+ setups (5/5 score), reduce size to 2.5%
- **Purpose**: Protect profits, avoid giving back gains

### **3. Max Daily Loss Limit**
- **Limit**: -2.5% account drawdown in single day
- **Action**: Stop all trading until next session
- **Purpose**: Prevent catastrophic loss days

### **4. Position Exposure Limits**
- **Max total exposure**: 30% of account across all positions
- **Per-trade limit**: 2-10% based on signal score
- **Purpose**: Prevent overconcentration risk

### **5. No-Trade Zones**

Bot skips entries when:
- ❌ Large unpredictable wicks (> 2% wick size)
- ❌ Low volume consolidation (< 50% average volume)
- ❌ Wide spreads (> 0.3%)
- ✅ Only trades clean, high-probability setups

## 🎓 Key Principles

1. **Frequency Meets Quality**: 12+ trades/hour but only on validated setups (2/5+ conditions)
2. **Risk-First Approach**: TSL, TTP, burn-down, profit lock prevent disasters  
3. **Automation = Discipline**: No emotional trades, no FOMO, no revenge trading
4. **24/7 Crypto Advantage**: Never sleep, never miss opportunities
5. **Device Independence**: Railway cloud hosting means your laptop/phone can be off
6. **Adaptive Intelligence**: No-trade zones filter bad markets automatically
7. **Trailing Mastery**: NIJA system locks profits while letting winners run

**High-Frequency Philosophy**:
> "More trades = more data = faster learning. But every trade must still earn its place through validation."

The 2/5 threshold doesn't mean "lower quality"—it means "more opportunities to capture edge in favorable conditions."

---

## 📈 Performance Expectations

**Realistic Targets**:
- Win Rate: 55-65% (good for algo trading)
- Average Win: +1.5% to +3.0%
- Average Loss: -0.8% to -1.2% (TSL protection)
- Daily Profit Target: +1% to +3% (conservative)
- Max Drawdown: -5% to -8% (normal volatility)

**Risk Factors**:
- Crypto Volatility: 24/7 markets can gap unexpectedly
- Exchange Fees: Coinbase fees ~0.5-0.6% per trade
- Slippage: Market orders may have price impact
- API Downtime: Exchange outages can prevent exits
- Flash Crashes: Stop-losses may not fill at expected prices

**Capital Requirements**:
- Minimum: $100 (supports $0.01+ position sizes)
- Recommended: $1,000+ (better fee absorption and position sizing)
- Optimal: $5,000+ (full flexibility across signal scores)

## 🎓 Trading Philosophy

> **"Discipline, not prediction, generates profits."**

NIJA embodies these core principles:

1. **Systematic Execution** → No emotions, no FOMO, no revenge trading
2. **Risk-First Approach** → Every trade has defined stop-loss and take-profit
3. **Let Winners Run** → Trailing system captures extended moves
4. **Cut Losers Fast** → TSL prevents small losses from becoming large
5. **Compound Relentlessly** → Profits automatically reinvested for exponential growth
6. **Adapt to Conditions** → Profit lock, burn-down, no-trade zones adjust to markets
7. **Quality Over Quantity** → 2/5 threshold ensures valid setups, not random entries

**The Edge**: Consistent application of a positive-expectancy strategy without human error or emotional interference.
