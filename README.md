## What NIJA Bot Is Capable Of

NIJA Bot is a **high-speed, AI-driven crypto trading bot** designed for aggressive yet safe trading. Its capabilities include:

- ⚡ **Live trading on funded Coinbase accounts**  
- 📈 **Automatic order execution** based on TradingView alerts  
- 🔒 **Safety checks**:
  - Minimum funded account threshold
  - Stops trading if no account is funded
- 📊 **Portfolio monitoring** in real time  
- 🧠 **Dynamic position sizing**:
  - Minimum 2% and maximum 10% of account equity per trade  
  - Bot adjusts allocation based on current account size and market signals
- 💡 **Webhook integration** for instant alert response  
- 🛡 **Code integrity enforcement**:
  - Nested folder structure prevents circular imports
  - Bot refuses to start if critical files are missing or misconfigured  

> ⚠️ NIJA is designed for advanced users. Never disable safeguards.

## Folder Structure

Nija/
├─ app/
│  ├─ init.py
│  ├─ start_bot_main.py
│  ├─ nija_client.py
│  ├─ app/                   # Nested app folder
│  │  ├─ init.py         # MUST exist
│  │  └─ webhook.py
├─ start_bot.py
├─ requirements.txt
└─ README.md

### Notes on Folder Structure

- `start_bot.py` → Entry point for the bot  
- `start_bot_main.py` → Main bot logic: initializes Coinbase client, checks funded accounts, starts webhook server  
- `nija_client.py` → Coinbase client code; fully connected to your funded account  
- `app/webhook.py` → Webhook server handling; must remain inside `app/app` to **avoid circular imports**  
- `FUND_THRESHOLD` is implemented: bot **will not trade** if no account meets minimum balance  

---

## Deployment Status

- **Container Status:** ✅ Active and running  
- **Webhook Server:** ✅ Started  
- **Coinbase Client:** ✅ Connected to funded account  
- **Trading Ready:** ✅ Yes, live and ready to execute trades  

---

## Important Warnings

1. **Do NOT move or rename the nested `app/app` folder** — this will break imports.  
2. **Do NOT import `start_bot_main` inside `webhook.py`** — prevents circular imports.  
3. **Lock this deployment**. Only test updates in a separate branch.  
4. **Minimum funded account check** is active. If no account is funded, bot will stop automatically.  
5. **Always verify your funded accounts** before trading; bot will not override safeguards.  

---

## Startup Command

Run the bot with:

```bash
python3 start_bot.py

This will:
	1.	Start the bot
	2.	Initialize Coinbase client
	3.	Check funded accounts
	4.	Start the webhook server
	5.	Begin listening for live trading signals

⸻

Recommended Best Practices
	•	Always verify funded account balance before trading
	•	Keep app/app/webhook.py unchanged unless you fully understand circular import constraints
	•	Use a separate test branch for any modifications
	•	Do not manually edit running containers; redeploy from this locked, stable version if needed

⸻

Status Summary
	•	✅ Stable and running
	•	✅ Connected to funded account
	•	✅ Webhook server started
	•	✅ Ready to trade
	•	✅ All safeguards active

# Nija Trading Bot

1. Copy `.env.example` → `.env` and fill your Coinbase PEM/ORG_ID
2. Deploy to Railway
3. Bot runs 24/7, trades automatically on Coinbase if SDK is available
4. If Coinbase SDK is unavailable or PEM invalid, bot runs in **safe dry-run mode**

## Startup Script

The `scripts/start_all.sh` script provides a robust startup mechanism with environment validation and flexible deployment options.

### Required Environment Variables

The startup script validates the following required environment variables:

- **COINBASE_API_KEY** - Your Coinbase API key
- **COINBASE_API_SECRET** - Your Coinbase API secret
- **COINBASE_PEM_CONTENT** - Your Coinbase PEM certificate content

If any required variable is missing, the script will exit with a non-zero status unless `ALLOW_MISSING_ENV=1` is set (see below).

### Optional Environment Variables

- **PORT** (default: `5000`) - The port on which the application will listen
- **WEB_CONCURRENCY** (default: `1`) - Number of gunicorn worker processes
- **ALLOW_MISSING_ENV** - Set to `1` to bypass environment validation for testing/demo environments

### Usage

Run the startup script:

```bash
./scripts/start_all.sh
```

For testing without required credentials:

```bash
ALLOW_MISSING_ENV=1 ./scripts/start_all.sh
```

### Features

- ✅ UTC timestamps on all log lines for easier troubleshooting
- ✅ Validates required environment variables before starting
- ✅ Attempts to change to `/app` directory (warns if not found, continues anyway)
- ✅ Tries `gunicorn` command first, falls back to `python -m gunicorn`, then `python main.py`
- ✅ Uses `exec` to ensure the process receives signals directly
- ✅ POSIX-compatible bash with `set -euo pipefail` for safety
